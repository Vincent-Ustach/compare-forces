##Comparing forces and potentials in ESPResSo.

This is a script that compares forces and potentials of angular bonds by numerical differentiation. It is an adaptation of a script called compare_potentials_and_forces.tcl from the ESPResSo simulation package. Rather than changing the bond distance by dr, this script changes the bond angle between three beads by d\theta.

To be done:
* Check the rotation
* Check the calculation of force
* Understand the scaling
